```

**What it does:**

## Data Structure

Each detail record contains:
- **documents_required**: Array of document requirements by student type (JSONB)
- **course_details**: Array of course information sections (JSONB)
- **lecture_details**: Array of lecture/training information (JSONB)
- **fees**: Object containing timings, course fees, and other fees (JSONB)

## Database Schema

The details table has a unique constraint on `(school_id, category_id)` to prevent duplicate entries for the same school-category combination.

- All JSON data is stored as JSONB for efficient querying and indexing
- The existing API endpoints automatically include details when fetching school information
